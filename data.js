        description: `I’m excited to share the result of my long and hard work—a short 3D animated film based on the Five Nights at Freddy’s universe.
Project Highlights:
- handmade assets: every model, environment, and texture was created manually by me.
- atmosphere and sound: I put a lot of effort into the sound design and final compositing. I tried to capture that signature, oppressive atmosphere of the original through lighting and ambient effects.
- i’ll be honest - the animation is a bit rough in places. I’m not a professional animator yet.

Also below you can see some "behind the scenes" shots.`,
